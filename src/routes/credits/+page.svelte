				<p>
					I made Portify not just to meet a practical need, but because I wanted to learn about new
					ways of building apps.
				</p>
				<p>
					All these libraries and frameworks share a theme in common: a focus on web standards and
					user-oriented values like performance and accessibility; elegant, intuitive APIs; and a
					fresh take on the developer experience.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm immensely grateful to the authors for their work, and for making it available to the
					community...

					<h3>Spotify TypeScript SDK</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
					This year's build was inspired by the announcement of the <a
						href="https://developer.spotify.com/blog/2023-07-03-typescript-sdk"
					>
						Spotify TypeScript SDK
					</a>
					by my super-talented friend
					<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thisisjofrank.bsky.social">Jo Franchetti</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The comprehensive type definitions didn't just make working with paged data a breeze but
					actually inspired the super simple infinite scroll implementation. Fantastic work.
				</p>

					<h3>SvelteKit</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
					I genuinely enjoy working with Svelte and SvelteKit: the combination makes the challenging
					easy and the features just keep getting better (hello Runes!).
				</p>
				<p>
					As much as I love Astro, and as much as I want to keep exploring options like Enhance, for
					an app like Portify it's genuinely difficult to imagine any other combination being as
					rewarding.

					<h3>Melt UI</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
					I'm delighted to see a component library matching Radix in quality brought to Svelte. Melt
					UI's builder pattern combines power with simplicity and the components are built with
					accessibility as a primary concern. Really impressive stuff.
				</p>
				<p>Bonus: being a headless UI library, it doesn't impose Tailwind on me.</p>

					<h3>Lucia Auth</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
					A library I just know I'll keep coming back to. OAuth may be more fiddly than hard, but
					Lucia does an amazing job of making the fiddly simple.
				</p>
				<p>
					The radical minimalism means that you're responsible for managing and refreshing your
					bearer tokens, but I <em>really</em> appreciate the relentless focus on doing the core part
					right.

					<h3>Turso DB</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
					The convergence of Edge Compute and libSQL's file-as-db architecture means Turso can offer
					500 databases at the free tier. Just phenomenal.
				</p>
				<p>
					The perfect pairing for Lucia, and so easy to work with that it's almost hard to resist
					the temptation to add more capabilities to your app!

					<h3>Drizzle ORM</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
					Real talk: the lack of database migration tooling for Node that even remotely matched what
					existed as standard for PHP, Python or Ruby was a major drag on me building db-backed
					projects in the past.
				</p>
				<p>I'm so glad I found Drizzle ðŸ¥°</p>

				<p>
					Adam Argyle's ever-expanding toolbox for CSS gives developers super powers via the medium
					of Custom Properties.
				</p>
				<p>
					Literally the first dependency I add to any project, and a constant source of inspiration
					and learning for me.
				</p>
				<p>If Portify looks nice then Adam is largely to blame.</p>
