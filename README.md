## About Portify

Portify helps you support the artists you love by adding purchase links to the tracks in your Spotify playlists.

Portify uses Spotify's Web API to add details like the track's key and tempo, while clicking the key button toggles between Camelot (useful for harmonic mixing) and musical notation.

The play button uses Spotify Connect to play tracks through the app... handy for previewing new music, remixes and browsing artist catalogues.

## Developing

To run the project locally you will need to create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following variables:

```bash
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID="..."
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET="..."
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI="..."

TURSO_DB_AUTH_TOKEN="..."
TURSO_DB_URL="libsql://<app>-<username>.turso.io"
```

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
